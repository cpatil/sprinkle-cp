module Sprinkle
  # An actor is a method of command delivery to a remote machine. It is the
  # layer between sprinkle and the SSH connection to run commands. This gives
  # you the flexibility to define custom actors, for whatever purpose you need.
  #
  # 99% of the time, however, the two built-in actors Sprinkle::Actors::Capistrano
  # and Sprinkle::Actors::Vlad will be enough.
